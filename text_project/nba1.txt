The Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers have discussed a three-team trade involving Paul George and Kevin Love.

In the discussed trade scenario, George would end up with the Cavaliers while Love would go to the Nuggets. 

While George would like to end up playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Cavaliers could risk trading for George due to the unique nature of competing for a title playing with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.

The Cavaliers would like to improve their team this offseason and be better suited to play against the Warriors, which George would do instead of Love.

One version of the three-team would trade would have Kenneth Faried going to the Cavaliers. The Nuggets have made upgrading the power forward position one of their priorities this offseason.

Denver made Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray off limits in trade talks.
