TITLE: DERM CONTAMINATED SITES IN MIAMI DADE COUNTY - AUGUST 2015

Geodataset Name:       MIAMI_DADE_DERM_AUG15
Geodataset Type:       SDE Feature Class
Geodataset Feature:    Point
Feature Count:         2421

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
This data set represents a point feature class of open DERM Contaminated sites -see phase code for status of site - in Miami Dade. Each feature identifies properties where environmental contamination has been documented in the soil or groundwater. Facilities get listed as a contaminated site by a DERM inspector who finds a violation on the property. Facilities that store potential contaminated materials are permitted and/or tracked by DERM. A site is removed from the active contaminated sites layer/list when the sites is found by DERM to be cleaned up.

of the original data layer's topology

This data is provided 'as is' by GeoPlan and is complete to our
knowledge.

GeoPlan relied on the integrity of the attribute information within
the original data.

Sites where DERM has documented contamination and the assessment/cleanup 
is ongoing.
  
Data is updated in GIS production via a batch job.


To identify the location of contaminated sites and to be used by the county 
for mapping and analysis purposes.

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

GeoPlan downloaded this dataset from the Miami Dade Department of 
Environmental Resources Management website
(http://gisweb.miamidade.gov/GISSelfServices/GeographicData/MDGeographicData.html) 
in January 2016. The data was downloaded as a shapefile and was in the 
following projection: NAD_1983_StatePlane_Florida_East_FIPS_0901_Feet. 
The dataset was projected to FGDL Albers HPGN.

When downloaded the shapefile was zipped in file called 
CONTAMINATEDSITE.ZIP. No metadata was included with this version, so 
metadata from May 2012 was modified to represent this August 2015 version.

- A DESCRIPT field was added based on TASK_NAME
- A FGDLAQDATE field was added based on date downloaded from source
- All records in the table were upcased
- Renamed file from contaminated sites to miami_dade_derm_aug15
