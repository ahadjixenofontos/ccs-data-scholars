The Los Angeles Lakers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs were among the teams that pursued a trade for Paul George aggressively leading up to the draft.

The Rockets and Lakers remain determined to keep pushing for a George trade, while the Cavaliers also are attempting to construct three-way scenarios involving Kevin Love.

The Celtics are expected to revisit discussions for Paul if they're able to sign Gordon Hayward in free agency. 

The Cavaliers believe trading for George could convince him to abandon his plan to join the Lakers in 2018.
